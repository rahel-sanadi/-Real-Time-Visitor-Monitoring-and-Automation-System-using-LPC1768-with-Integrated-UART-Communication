# Real-Time Visitor Monitoring and Automation System using LPC1768 with Integrated UART Communication

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time visitor monitoring and automation system** on the **LPC1768 ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller**.  
It combines hardware and firmware solutions to provide automated visitor tracking, data logging, and gate control.

The system uses:
- **UART communication** for serial monitoring and debugging.
- **IR sensors** to detect entry and exit events.
- **PWM-controlled servo motor** for automated gate operation.
- **RTC (Real-Time Clock)** for accurate visitor time-stamping.
- **I²C-based EEPROM** for reliable visitor data storage.
- **Menu-driven interface** for system control and monitoring.

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. **Visitor arrives** → IR entry sensor detects presence.  
2. **Servo motor opens gate** → controlled via PWM.  
3. **Visitor logged** → RTC timestamps entry, data stored in EEPROM.  
4. **Visitor exits** → IR exit sensor detects departure, event logged.  
5. **Data monitoring** → UART displays logs in real-time.  
6. **User interaction** → menu-driven operations for log retrieval & system settings.
